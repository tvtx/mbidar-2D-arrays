# Week 2 Day 1: 2D Array Practice

In class today, you'll be writing some code to practice working with 2D Arrays

Instructions for the in-class work and the homework can be found on Canvas. 

<br />

Add code to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java), and then test your code by running the main method in [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) file. 

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

## Run your tests with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyTests.java](src/test/java/MyTests.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make test
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```
